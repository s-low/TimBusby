# TimBusby
Portfolio site of the highly charismatic and very imaginary: 'Tim Busby - Freelance Web Developer'. Built for a web technologies assignment.

To run the site locally, clone the repo and execute: node server.js from the /Client directory. I've dumped some sample screenshots into the /Screenshots directory too.
